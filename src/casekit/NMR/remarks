coding:

-   in parseRawData class:
        -   new: usage of Assignment class objects:
            -> atom properties for signals, e.g. HMBC, are not longer set
        -   control function should be implemented for assigning of protons:
            -> no. of assigned protons (HSQC, HMBC, ...) vs. DEPT information and for other heavy atoms too
            -> how many protons for one shift value (carbons or other heavy atoms) are still left?
        -   some function descriptions (javadoc) are deprecated and have to be updated
-   add exceptions where needed
